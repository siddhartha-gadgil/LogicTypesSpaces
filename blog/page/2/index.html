  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="grammar">Grammar</h2>

<p>A first-order languages has words and phrases (expressions) belonging to four types/type families.</p>

<ul>
  <li>term</li>
  <li>formula</li>
  <li>function - determined by degree</li>
  <li>predicate - determined by degree.</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that the last two types can only have words as members, i.e., we cannot create elements of these types. So for a fixed language, there are only a fixed number of types. Usually functions and predicates have degrees $1$ or $2$, so there are only about $6$ types of expressions.</p>

<h2 id="formation-rules">Formation rules.</h2>

<p>The formation rule for new phrases are entirely in terms of the types of its constituent words/phrases, and there are typically only about $6$ such types. This means the language is not very <em>expressive</em>.</p>

<h2 id="consequences-of-low-expressiveness">Consequences of low expressiveness</h2>

<p>Depending on ones objective, there are two ways to cope with lack of expressiveness.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In <em>weakly typed</em> or <em>dynamically typed</em> programming languages, a lot of expressions are permitted (at compile time, or even run time) but lead to errors.</li>
  <li>In mathematics, one embeds actually mathematics in the not very expressive language of set theory paying the price of being verbose and opaque.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2 id="set-theory">Set theory</h2>

<p>A <em>set</em> is a collection of objects with no further structure. Thus, the only property (or function) associated with a set $S$ is <em>membership</em> - a different object $x$ may or may not belong to $S$ (denoted as usual $x\in S$).</p>

<p>It is natural to try to reverse this and consider, for any property of objects (for example sets) the set that consists of those satisfying this (for example all sets that have a certain property). Cantor discovered, however, that this leads to paradoxes. For instance, Russell’s paradox appears if we consider the set $ S = \{X : X \notin X\}.$</p>

<p>We ask whether $S\in S$. By the definition of $S$, if $X\in X$, then $X\notin X$ and vice versa.</p>

<p>To prevent such paradoxes, we cannot allow sets to be defined by arbitrary properties. We do of course see definitions that look very similar to the above in mathematics - these are definitions of <em>subsets</em> of a given set. Indeed one of the valid ways of defining a set is to consider the elements of a given set that satisfy some property.</p>

<p>Clearly defining only subsets of pre-existing sets will not get us far. Instead, set theory is formulated in terms of axioms, many of which assert the existence of various sets. For instance, if $S$ is a set then there is an axiom asserting the existence of the <em>power set</em> of $S$, whose elements are subsets of $S$. Sometimes we need to consider collections, such as that consisting of all groups, that are so large that they cannot be treated as sets but are considered <em>classes</em> instead.</p>

<h2 id="foundations-using-set-theory">Foundations using set theory</h2>

<p>Sets (and classes) form the objects in the usual foundations of mathematics, analogous to the vocabulary of the language of mathematics. However to describe theorems, proofs, or even properties describing sets, we need rules telling us how to form <em>terms</em> - corresponding to sets that may depend on variables, as well as <em>formulas</em> - corresponding to properties. We also need to specify the rules of deduction by which we can show that a theorem (given by a formula) is true. Standard foundations are the rules of <em>predicate calculus</em>.</p>

<p>These foundations can indeed express, or rather encode, all real mathematics. But this encoding is often very much longer than real life mathematics and are also opaque. If one actually expects to fully formalize mathematics, it is better to use some form of <em>type theory</em>.</p>

<h2 id="type-theory">Type theory</h2>

<p>In type theory we replace sets by types, and the notion of membership $x\in S$, $x$ belongs to the set $S$, by having an appropriate type $x : T$, i.e., $x$ has type $T$. The crucial difference is that objects of a given type $T$ (unlike elements of a set $S$) are expected to be of the same nature. For instance, the a typical type is $\mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$, consisting of functions from $\mathbb{N}$ to $\mathbb{N}$.</p>

<p>Thus, for example $f : \mathbb{N}\to \mathbb{N}$ gives a lot of information about $f$. In particular we know that if $a : \mathbb{N}$, it is meaningful to talk of $f(a)$ and that this  is  a natural number too. Typically types allow us to restrict which expressions are meaningful, and infer the type of a meaningful expression. Such information is very useful in programming languages (where it is called type checking) - not only revealing errors without running a program (i.e., at compile time) but allowing a detailed analysis of the program which is used by tools.</p>

<p>In practical programming languages, type checking may be more or less strict - with stricter checking meaning that expressions that can cause error while running being more likely to be rejected at compile time itself. Some languages will treat an expression $f(a)$ as valid as long as $f$ is a function, and only give an error if $a$ has type different from the domain of $f$ when we actually try to compute this expression, while stricter  languages will reject such expression  unless the types match. However in practical code a function $f(x, y) = x/y$ will generally be regarded at best as a function of two real variables, with the compiler not checking that $y$ is non-zero.</p>

<p>There is another more conceptual choice in the form of type theory considered - whether or not to allow sub-typing. For instance, we can either regard every natural number as a rational number, or work with  the canonical inclusion that takes a natural number $n$  to the rational number $n/1$.</p>

<h2 id="types-as-spaces">Types as spaces</h2>

<p>With  all these choices, type theory  is a very fragmented subject, with both practical engineering considerations and whims dictating the many choices. It is clear to a large extend what behaviour we expect from sets, and this anchors our axiomatization. Traditionally type theory is not constrained in such a manner.</p>

<p>Homotopy type theory is born out of an observed deep connection between (a form of) type theory and topology. Thus behaviour that we  expect from topology guides our  choices, so we can hope for  coherent standard foundations. We shall see that this connection is indeed extremely fruitful. </p>

  <div class="entry-content"><h3 id="recursive-structures">Recursive structures</h3>

<p>A sentence is made of phrases, which in turn are made of words, just as matter is made molecules, which are in turn made of atoms. Just as atoms are of different types (elements), words are of different types (parts of speech).</p>

<p>But there is a crucial difference. A typical sentence consists of a <em>verb phrase</em> and a <em>noun phrase</em>. These may be single words - verbs or nouns, but can also be built from words and phrases, including verb phrases and noun phrases. Thus phrases are <strong>recursive</strong> - they can be built from other phrases of the same type. This gives language a richness that is absent in <strong>hierarchical</strong> structures such as matter, where each level is built from simpler structures.</p>

<p>It is this richness of language that makes it a natural model for logic, and much of formal logic was traditionally modeled on language. We see this briefly in the case of first order logic, before turning to an overview of how and why to go beyond this.</p>

<h3 id="first-order-logic">First order logic</h3>

<p>First-order logic is based on a language with words being <em>variables</em>, <em>constants</em>, <em>functions</em>, <em>relations</em> (predicates),  <em>quantifiers</em>, <em>logical operations</em>. There are two types of phrases - <strong>terms</strong> and <strong>formulas</strong>, which are built out of these words. Terms can be single words - constants or variables, or can be built by applying a function to the appropriate number of terms; formulas can be built from terms. This is very similar to a formal grammar for a language.</p>

<p>Traditional foundations of mathematics are based on <em>first order logic</em> giving the grammar - i.e., rules for constructing terms, formulas, proofs etc., with the vocabulary of <em>set theory</em>. This has proved sufficient to work consistently. Yet there are serious limitations.</p>

<p>We can build functions by applying functions to terms, but not to other functions (functions are not terms). This means that we cannot naturally express functions of functions, such as the norm of a linear transformation. A naive approach will be to simply treat functions as terms, and allow expressions like $f(f)$, but this leads to paradoxes.</p>

<p>In set theory the approach taken  is to use indirect descriptions - functions as relations, which are sets of pairs. This is fine in terms of issues like paradoxes and consistency, but results in formalizations of actual mathematics being absurdly verbose and bearing hardly any resemblance to real mathematics.</p>

<h3 id="type-theory">Type theory</h3>

<p>While terms in first-order logic, like phrases in a language, can be built recursively, the <em>types</em> of words, like the part of speech, are a fixed finite set - variables, constants, functions, quantifiers etc. In particular there is no type representing functions from a given type to another given type. In <em>type theory</em>, we allow not only terms but their types to be recursively generated, with rules telling us how to construct both terms and types, and how to determine the type of a term.</p>

<p>There are many flavours of type theory. It was discovered by Curry and Howard that <em>dependent type theory</em> contains not only set theory but the usual rules of reasoning, making for very efficient and elegant foundations. We shall study a flavour of dependent type theory due to Per Martin-Löf, which turns out to have remarkable connections to topology.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At the core of homotopy type theory (and its predecessors) is the idea of <em>propostions as types</em>. Namely, we interpret logical propositions - statements that are either true or false, as types, with a proposition being true if and only if the corresponding type has an element (i.e., there is an object with that type). The Curry-Howard correspondence lets us embed all of logic into type theory in the manner.</p>

<h3 id="true-and-false">True and False</h3>

<p>We begin by representing the two simplest propositions: true - always true,  and false.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>True and False types

<p>The $True$ type has just one constructor, giving an object with type $True$. On the other hand, the $False$ type has no constructors, so there are no objects of type $False$.</p>

<p>There are various ways of building propositions from other propositions. We see how these translate to constructions of types.</p>

<h3 id="logical-implies">Logical implies</h3>

<p>If $P$ and $Q$ are propositions, which we identify with their corresponding types. We interpret the proposition $P \implies Q$ as the function type $P \to Q$.</p>

<h3 id="some-deductions">Some deductions</h3>

<p><em>Modus Ponens</em> is the rule of deduction (due to Aristotle) that says that if the proposition $P$ is true, and $P$ implies $Q$, then $Q$ is true. We can prove this in the types interpretation. Namely, Modus Ponens transaltes to the statement that if we have an objects of type $P$ and $P \to Q$, then we have an object of type $Q$. We get an object of type $Q$ by function application.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Modus Ponens

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Next, we see my favourite method of proof - vacuous implication. This says that a false statement implies everything, i.e., for any proposition $P$, we have $False \implies P$, which in type theory says $False\to P$ has objects.</p>

<p>As the $False$ type has no cases at all, a function is defined on $False$ by using an absurd pattern, which just says that there are no cases, so no definition is needed.</p>

<h3 id="even-and-odd-numbers">Even and Odd numbers</h3>

<p>Next, we define a type family Even n which is non-empty if and only if n is even. To do this, we see that a number is even if and only if it is even as a consequence of the rules</p>

<ul>
  <li>$0$ is even.</li>
  <li>If $n$ is even, so is $n + 2$.
*
Thus, we can define the inductive type family:</li>
</ul>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We can prove that $2$ is even by applying the second rule, with $n=0$, to the first rule (telling us that $0$ is even).</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>2 is Even
</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We next show that $1$ is odd. This means that we have to show that the type $Even 1$ is empty. While rules let us construct objects, and verify their types, there is no rule that tells us directly that a type is empty.</p>

<p>However, there is a nice way of capturing that a type $A$ is empty - if there is a function from $A$ to the empty type $False$, then $A$ must be empty - there is nowhere for an object of type $A$ to be mapped.</p>

<p>Indeed, what we prove is that there is a function from $Even\ 1$ to $False$ ; we define this using an absurd pattern.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>1 is odd

<h3 id="the-identity-type">The identity type</h3>

<p>One of the most fundamental concepts in homotopy type theory is the identity type family, representing equality between objects with a given type. This is an inductive type family, generated by the reflexivity constructor giving an equality between an object and itself.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>The identity type
</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Note that while this is an inductive type family, for a fixed object a the type $a==a$ is <em>not</em> an inductive type defined by $refl(a)$, i.e., we cannot define (dependent) functions on this type but just defining them on the reflexivity constructor. This is a subtle point, which will become clearer as we look at the topological interpretation. We shall study the identity type extensively.</p>

<p>For now, let us show some basic properties of the identity type. All these are proved by constructing objects by pattern matching (recall that these are dependent functions, so we are formally constructing them by induction, not recursion).</p>

<p>Firstly, if $f$ is a function and $a==b$ (i.e., there is an object of type $a==b$), then $f(a)==f(b)$ (again, we mean there is an object of this type).</p>

<p>There is a new Agda feature we have used in the proof of transitivity: the <em>dot notation</em>. Notice that we have a term <strong>.a</strong> - this says that we can deduce, <em>from the types</em>, that $a$ is the only possibility at its position in the pattern.</p>

<h3 id="for-all">For all</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a type $A$ and a family of types $P(a)$ (which we regard as propositions), with a type associated to each object $a$ of type $A$. Then all the types $P(a)$ have objects  (i.e., all corresponding propositions are true) if and only if there is a dependent function mapping each object $a$ of type $A$ to an object of type  $P(a)$. Thus, the logical statement</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\forall a \in A\ P(a)</script>

<p>translates to the product type</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\prod\limits_{a : A} P(a).</script>

<p>In Agda, we represent the product type as $(a : A) \to P(a)$</p>

<h3 id="a-proof-by-induction">A proof by induction</h3>

<p>We can now prove a more substantial result. Namely, suppose we have a function $f : \Bbb{N}\to \Bbb{N}$ , and suppose for all $n\in \Bbb{N}$ we have $f(n) = f(n+1)$, then we show that, for all $n$, $f(n)=f(0)$.</p>

<p>Such a statement is normally proved by induction (indeed any proof must reduce to induction). We see that our pattern matching rules for constructing dependent functions suffice to prove this - this is why the dependent function that gives them is called the induction function.</p>

<p>Let us look at the statement and proof more carefully. Firstly, note that the statement is of the form</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> (f : \Bbb{N} \to \Bbb{N}) \to P(f) \to Q(f).</script>

<p>As we have seen, the first term is a translation of $\forall f : \Bbb{N} \to \Bbb{N}$, so the statement says that for all functions $f : \Bbb{N} \to \Bbb{N}$ (or any other codomain with obvious modifications), we have $P(f) \to Q(f)$.</p>

<p>This in turn is a translation of $P(f) \implies Q(f)$. So we can regard  $P(f)$ as the hypothesis, for a fixed function $f$,  and $Q(f)$  as the desired conclusion.</p>

<p>The hypothesis P(f) is the statement</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display"> (m : \Bbb{N}) \to f(m+1) == f(m)</script>

<p>which is just the statement that for all $m$, $f(m+1)=f(m)$.  Finally, the conclusion $Q(f)$ just says that $f(n)=f(o)$ for all $n$.</p>

<p>We now look at the proof. The two constructors correspond to the base case and the induction step. Here the base case is just $f(0)=f(0)$, which follows from reflexivity of equality.</p>

<p>The induction step is more complicated. We prove the result for $n+1$ assuming the result for $n$. The main hypothesis $\forall m, f(m+1) = f(m)$, is, by pattern matching, $adjEq$. The right hand side, which is the proof in the case of $n+1$, is obtained from:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The hypothesis for $n$,  giving $f(n+1) = f(n).$</li>
  <li>The induction hypothesis, which is the theorem we are proving applied to $n$, giving $f(n)=0.$</li>
  <li>Transitivity of equality.
*
The proof is obtained by applying the function corresponding to the transitivity of equality to the two objects corresponding to the other ingredients above.</li>
</ul>

<p>This proof is remarkable in many ways. First of all, note that this is no longer or more complicated than an informal proof. Further, note that we did not have to invoke the usual induction axiom schema, but instead just used the rules for constructing objects. Most significantly, as most of our types are inductive type (or type families), we get recursive definitions and inductive proofs in all these cases.</p>

<p>Indeed,  using recursive definitions for inductive types we get all so called <em>universal properties</em>. Furthermore, traditionally universal properties require a separate uniqueness statement. But recursion-induction is powerful enough to even give the uniqueness statements for universal properties. This means a great deal of mathematical sophistication (universal algebra, various aspects of category theory) are encapsulated in these simple functions.</p>

<h3 id="more-types-for-propositions">More types for propositions</h3>

<p>We now see the types corresponding to the other ways of combining propositions : and, or and there exists.</p>

<p>Firstly, if $A$ and $B$ are types corresponding to propositions, then there are objects with each of these types if and only if there is a pair $(a, b)$ of the pair type $A \times B$, which we define as follows.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Pair type

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>We have to use square brackets as parenthesis have a special meaning in Agda. Observe that there is a single constructor that takes as input an object in $A$ and an object in $B$. We regard the result as the pair.</p>

<p>Next, suppose $A$ and $B$ are types corresponding to propositions and we wish to construct a type corresponding to $A$ <em>or</em> $B$, then we require a type whose elements are elements of $A$ and elements of $B$, or more accurately the images of such elements under constructors. This is the direct sum type.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Direct Sum type

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Finally, if we are given a collection of types $B(a)$ for objects $a$ of type $A$, we construct the type corresponding to at least one of these types having an element, i.e., a <em>there exists</em> type.</p>

<div class="bogus-wrapper"><notextile><figure class="code"><figcaption><span>Sigma type
</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class="line-number">1</span>

</span><span class="line">  <span class="err">ι</span> <span class="kt">:</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">a</span> <span class="kt">:</span> <span class="kt">A</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">→</span> <span class="kt">B</span> <span class="n">a</span> <span class="err">→</span> <span class="err">Σ</span> <span class="kt">A</span> <span class="kt">B</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div>

<p>Notice that the constructor for this type has as input an element $a$ and an element of type $B(a)$. Such elements exist if and only if some $B(a)$ is non-empty, i.e., the corresponding proposition is true.</p>

<p>As we see, we can express all the usual mathematical statements using types built up using our basic constructions: inductive types, functions and dependent functions. We have also seen that the basic rules for constructing objects are powerful rules of deduction. However, there are some things they cannot deduce, for instance the statement (called the axiom of extensionality) that if $f, g: A\to B$ are function with $f(a)=g(a)$ for all $a \in A$, then $f=g$. Hence, we have to introduce this as a postulate - we just postulate that  there is an object (which we give a name) of a given type.</p>

<p>We can similarly introduce axioms specific to a domain, say Euclidean geometry, by postulating them in a module.</p>
